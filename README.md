**C Programming**

This project is a portable song player reminiscent of the old iPod features. The basis would be a B-L4S5I board with pre-programmed songs, with options to pause, resume and change to the next song using the button, as well as changing between three predefined volumes using the accelerometer. The songs would be stored on the Flash Memory and outputted using the DAC speaker, and have their lyrics and title displayed on the UART.
